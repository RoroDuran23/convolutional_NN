# Final Convolutional Neural Network

## Overview
This script, `FinalConvolution.py`, implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. It utilizes the Keras library to build and train the network. The CIFAR-10 dataset comprises 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Keras
- NumPy

## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset is automatically downloaded and loaded using Keras' dataset utilities.

## Features
- Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network using Keras.
- Utilizes layers such as Conv2D, Dense, Flatten, and MaxPooling2D.
- Normalization and centering of the dataset for improved training efficiency.
